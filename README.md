- 👋 Hi, I’m @marescanog
- 👀 I’m interested in Dungeons and Dragons, playing and making videogames.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and Java (for my university CS course), C# and C++ for gamedev. A little bit of javascript for webdev too.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the development of games on the Unity Engine. I'm also interrested in the Unreal engine but I have more experience with Unity.
